"Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
Will come when it will come."
